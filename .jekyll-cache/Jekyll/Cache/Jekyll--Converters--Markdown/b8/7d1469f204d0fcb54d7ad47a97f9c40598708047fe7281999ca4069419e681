<p>While creating a server through the Azure portal, the <strong>Pricing Tier</strong> window is where you select either <strong>Locally Redundant</strong> or <strong>Geographically Redundant</strong> backups for your server. This window is also where you select the <strong>Backup Retention Period</strong> - how long (in number of days) you want the server backups stored for.</p>

<p>The backup retention period governs how far back in time a point-in-time restore can be retrieved, since itâ€™s based on backups available. Point-in-time restore is described further in the following section.</p>

<p>Azure Database for PostgreSQL allows you to restore the server back to a point-in-time and into to a new copy of the server. You can use this new server to recover your data, or have your client applications point to this new server.</p>

<p>For example, if a table was accidentally dropped at noon today, you could restore to the time just before noon and retrieve the missing table and data from that new copy of the server. Point-in-time restore is at the server level, not at the database level.</p>

<p>The following steps restore the sample server to a point-in-time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In the Azure portal, select your Azure Database for PostgreSQL server.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the toolbar of the serverâ€™s Overview page, select Restore.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The new server created by point-in-time restore has the same server admin login name and password that was valid for the existing server at the point-in-time chose. You can change the password from the new serverâ€™s Overview page.</p>

<p>The new server created during a restore does not have the firewall rules or VNet service endpoints that existed on the original server. These rules need to be set up separately for this new server.</p>
